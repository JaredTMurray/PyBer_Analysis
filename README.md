# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

I have created serveral visualizations, Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations produce will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. The following was implemented 
- DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (it consists of city_data and ride_data, both of which are csv files. These csv files were merged to form the dataframe  pyber_data_df).
- Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Please click on the hyperlink [Pyber_Challenge](https://github.com/JaredTMurray/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb) to view the code of the analysis
- Finally, I wrote and submitted a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: 
### Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
The following dataframes, counts were created : urban_cities_df, suburban_cities_df and rural_cities_df, urban_ride_count, suburban_ride_count and rural_ride_count, 

![Number of Rides per city](https://github.com/JaredTMurray/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Number_rides_cities%20.png)

There are more drivers in Urban cities (Carriemouth:1404, Christopherfurt:1107) than in Suburban and Rural cities. Overall, the rural cities had the least amount of drivers with Jessicaport only having 6. 

![Number of Drivers per city](https://github.com/JaredTMurray/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Sum_drivers_city.png)

- Urban cities have the highest fares especially in the cities Carriemouth: $764.49, Christopherfurt: $661.55. 

- Average fare per ride for each city type yields Brandonfort, which is a Rural city Bradshawfurt at $40.064000. 

- The highest average fare per driver for each city is the rural city: Jessicaport $36.013333, while the lowest average fares were in Urban Cities. 


Of all the cites stats was calculated. This summary showed the highest fares, riders and drivers were in Suburban areas while rural had the least.



### Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

Summary
There are three recommendations I would suggest to the CEO. In the middle of February to mid March, people travel more in the Urban cities, increase marketing in the urban and suburban cities. 
In the month of May, there was a decrease in travelling in all three cities. In the month of May, travelling around in all three city types decreased, hence, I would suggest decreasing the number of drivers around this time of year.  
In the suburban area, during mid April to near the end of the month, there should be an increase in the number of drivers because the demand takes a sharp increase.  


##  Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
