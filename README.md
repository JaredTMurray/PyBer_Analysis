# PyBer_Analysis
The analysis should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis: 

Serveral visualizations, Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations produce will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. the Following were implemented the 
- DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
- Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
- Finally, youâ€™ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types


### Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
### Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
